## Conclusion

This project aims to empower AtliQ Grands with data-driven insights to regain market share and revenue. By implementing the outlined metrics and dashboard, management can make informed strategic decisions to enhance their competitive positioning.
●	Atliq Grands noticed a loss in their market share and revenue over a few months. To diagnose the cause of this loss, they needed a way to analyze this. I streamlined a dashboard in Power BI using 3 months of data.
●	With this dashboard, the Revenue team of Atliq Grands was able to gain insights into their revenue trend. This could help in regaining their revenue and market share by 20% in the next month.
